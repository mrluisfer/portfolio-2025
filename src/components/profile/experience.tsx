        I developed a unified platform to optimize products and accelerate delivery, improved
        performance by 60% through API migration, and enhanced web performance by implementing best
        practices. I contributed to integrating tools like Sentry for API monitoring and
        participated in code reviews to ensure quality and scalability. I worked on integrating
        cookies for customer tracking, contributed to Next.js and HubSpot integration for the
        companyâ€™s blog, and helped refactor the landing page with modern technologies, ensuring
        scalability. I also contributed to maintaining and improving the landing page and other
        products, following best practices and collaborating closely with the team to ensure timely
        delivery using agile methodologies.
